This is my personal page, where information about myself, my work and projects is displayed.

It is also my first attempt at web development. 
I followed the curriculum available at [bento.io](https://www.bento.io/tracks) to learn and understand the basics of front-end web development.

The page design was inspired in a friend of a friend's personal page [André Alves](http://anpa.github.io/).

##Libraries used:
* HTML5 Boilerplate template
* Bootstrap framework
* jQuery
