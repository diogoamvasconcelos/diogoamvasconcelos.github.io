This is my personal page, where information about myself, my work and projects is displayed.

It is also my first attempt at web development. I followed the curriculum available at [bento.io](https://www.bento.io/tracks) to learn and understand the basics of front-end web development.

Libraries used:
* HTML5 Boilerplate template
* Bootstrap framework
* jQuery

The page design was inspired in a friend of a friend personal page [Andr√© Alves](http://anpa.github.io/).
